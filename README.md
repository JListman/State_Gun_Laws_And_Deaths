# State_Gun_Laws_And_Deaths

Combine data on gun laws from US Sates between 1991-2017 with CDC data from 1999 to 2015 on deaths per state where cause of death involves a firearm (regardless of reason: accident, suicide, murder,...) & make a data visualization.

Datasets overlap from 1999 to 2015. This analysis uses 2015 data.
