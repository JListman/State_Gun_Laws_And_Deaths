Notes:
Caveats:	As of April 3, 2017, the underlying cause of death has been revised for 125 deaths in 2014. More information.
Circumstances in Georgia for the years 2008 and 2009 have resulted in unusually high death counts for the ICD-10 cause of death code R99, "Other ill-defined and unspecified causes of mortality." Caution should be used in interpreting these data. More information.
Circumstances in New Jersey for the year 2009 have resulted in unusually high death counts for the ICD-10 cause of death code R99, "Other ill-defined and unspecified causes of mortality" and therefore unusually low death counts in other ICD-10 codes, most notably R95, "Sudden Infant Death Syndrome" and X40-X49, "Unintentional poisoning." Caution should be used in interpreting these data. More information.
Circumstances in California resulted in unusually high death counts for the ICD-10 cause of death code R99, "Other ill-defined and unspecified causes of mortality" for deaths occurring in years 2000 and 2001. Caution should be used in interpreting these data. More information.
The population figures for year 2015 are bridged-race estimates of the July 1 resident population, from the Vintage 2015 postcensal series released by NCHS on June 28, 2016. The population figures for year 2014 are bridged-race estimates of the July 1 resident population, from the Vintage 2014 postcensal series released by NCHS on June 30, 2015. The population figures for year 2013 are bridged-race estimates of the July 1 resident population, from the Vintage 2013 postcensal series released by NCHS on June 26, 2014. The population figures for year 2012 are bridged-race estimates of the July 1 resident population, from the Vintage 2012 postcensal series released by NCHS on June 13, 2013. The population figures for year 2011 are bridged-race estimates of the July 1 resident population, from the Vintage 2011 postcensal series released by NCHS on July 18, 2012. Population figures for 2010 are April 1 Census counts. The population figures for years 2001 - 2009 are bridged-race estimates of the July 1 resident population, from the revised intercensal county-level 2000 - 2009 series released by NCHS on October 26, 2012. Population figures for 2000 are April 1 Census counts. Population figures for 1999 are from the 1990-1999 intercensal series of July 1 estimates. Population figures for the infant age groups are the number of live births. 
Note: Rates and population figures for years 2001 - 2009 differ slightly from previously published reports, due to use of the population estimates which were available at the time of release.
The population figures used in the calculation of death rates for the age group 'under 1 year' are the estimates of the resident population that is under one year of age. More information.
Changes to cause of death classification affect reporting trends. More information.
